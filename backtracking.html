        <h1>Backtracking</h1>
        <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
        <p> The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After
            you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
            choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good
            sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
        <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
            though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf.At each node,
            beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a
            leaf.</p>
        <p> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your
            most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke
            the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options
            left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>

        <p> this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of
            choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data
            structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it
            is called depth-first tree searching.)

        <h3> the backtracking algorithm</h3>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border: 1px solid black;" width="900px"
        height="220px">
        <pre style="color:blue;"> boolean solve(Node n) { 
            if n is a leaf node { 
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                 else return false
             } else {
                for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
             } 
                return false 
            } 
        }
           </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border: 1px solid black;" width="900px"
        height="220px">
        <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the
            algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes
            on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no
            path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border-radius:20px;">
        <h3> How does this work?</h3>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do
            is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code,
            this is done by the lines</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border: 1px solid black;" width="900px"
        height="220px">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
                for each child c of n {
                     if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
                    } return false
            </pre>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border-radius:20px;">
        <p>
            Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable;
            if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is
            done by the lines
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border: 1px solid black;" width="900px"
        height="220px">
        <pre style="color: blue;">if n is a leaf node {
             if the leaf is a goal node, return true
              else return false
             }
            </pre>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should
        understand it thoroughly. Another way of
        stating it is as follows:</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border-radius:20px;">
        <h3>.To search a tree:</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched
                them all unsuccessfully.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border-radius:20px;">
        <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
        <p>acktracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
            algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px; border: 1px solid black;" width="900px" height="220px">
        <pre style="color: blue;" margin-left="10px">boolean solve(Node n) { 
            put node n on the stack; 
            while the stack is not empty{
              if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf
               { 
                if it is a goal node, return true 
                else pop it off the stack 
            } else {
                 if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                  push the next untried child onto the stack
                   else pop the node off the stack 
                } return false
             }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto
        the stack are the children of the node
        currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the
        stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known
        that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the
        stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on
        the stack form (in reverse order) a path from
        the root to a goal node.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the
        path information is embodied (in reverse
        order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node
        at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly
        to print (in reverse order) the nodes along
        the successful path:</p>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px; border: 1px solid black;" width="900px" height="220px">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean solve(Node n) { 
            if n is a leaf node { 
                if the leaf is a goal node {
                     print n 
                     return true 
                    }
                     else return false
                     } else {
                         for each child c of n { 
                            if solve(c) succeeds { 
                                print n
                                 return true 
                                } 
                            } return false
                         } 
                        }
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border-radius:20px;">
        <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem,
            they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
        </p>
        <p> for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the
            checkmate and stalemate solutions </p>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for
            example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method </strong> (or you
            could even call it
            <strong>isLeaf</strong>). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any
            possible moves
            remain.
        </p>
        <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of
            its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this
            look simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of n</strong>. In reality, it may be difficult to
            figure out what the
            possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node
            can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the
            arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep
            track of which ones you've already examined?</p>
        <p>rack of which ones you've already examined? The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of
            the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there
            from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is
            empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but
            it may require quite a lot of additional work. </p>
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <strong>children 1 through n</strong>, and try them in numerical
            order. Then, if
            you have just tried <strong>child k</strong>, you know that you have already tried children 1 through k-1,
            and you have not
            yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always
            try <strong>red first, then yellow, then green,</strong> then blue. If child yellow fails, you know to try
            child green next.
            If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <strong> (or perhaps
                north, east,south, west). </strong>
            I</p>
        <p> It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a <strong>In the chess game
                example,</strong> you
            might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in
            addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered. You can probably find some
            way to order the children of a node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you should use it; but if it
            is too cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list of untried children.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 150px; border: 4px; margin-right: 150px; border-radius:20px;">
        <h3>Example:Search Tree</h3>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We
            will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree. </p>
        <p>. A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can
            reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred
            to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root
            node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary
            tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first
            example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
        <p> Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class</p>
    </div>
    <div style="border:1px solid black; margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px; width: 900px; height: 220px;">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            public class BinaryTree { 
                BinaryTree leftChild = null;
                 BinaryTree rightChild = null;
                  boolean isGoalNode = false; 
                  String name;
                  
                  BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) { 
                    this.name = name;
                     leftChild = left; 
                     rightChild = right; 
                     this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                     } 
                    }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
        Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above
        binary tree.</p>

                         c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
                          d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false); 
                          e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);

    </div>
    <p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
        Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:

            <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with

        <h3>What are the children?</h3>
        <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore
            all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as
            far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you
            may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion. </p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a
            plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two
            countries that share a border are the same color.</p>
        <p>. To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on,
            until all countries are colored.</p>
        <p>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you
            are at a goal node.</p>
        <p>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and
            when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</p>
        <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily
            solvable; after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
        <strong>boolean mapIsOK()</strong><br>
        Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.
        <strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</strong><br>
        Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given
        color.
        <strong>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column) </strong><br>
        Used by both methods to find the nebrxt "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the
        checkerboard).

    <p style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure
        (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth.
        Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential
        growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
        guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!

            Debugging techniques
        </h3>
        <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes
            we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of
            print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying
            to debug recursive routines.</p>
        <h3>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits</h3>
        <p> Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important
            ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it
            leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their
            corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
        <h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging. </h3>
        <p>e specialized print methods for debugging. Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also,
            remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can
            affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but
            in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>

        <h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
        <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements
            as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away? </p>
        <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit
            (or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of
            work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with
            return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new
            bugs into your program. </p>
        <p> simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example</p>

        <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as
            in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point.
            Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the
            programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order.</p>
